									<h2 id="what-are-electron-orbitals">What are Electron Orbitals?</h2>
								</div>
								<p>Electron orbitals, also called wave functions, represent a prediction of where an electron is at in an atom relative to its nucleus at that point in time. This is the result of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which is an argument that an electron's exact position cannot be known, but its general location can be predicted fairly accurately.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Electron orbitals have certain directional properties, shapes, and sizes</li>
									<li>The location of an electron relative to its nucleus is predicted by squaring the wave function &Psi;<sup>2</sup></li>
									<li>The principal quantum number <em>n</em>, represents the energy of an orbital along with something called its shell</li>
									<li>The four atomic orbitals are: s, p, d, and f</li>
								</ul>

								<div class="big-section-heading">
									<h2 id="what-are-electron-orbitals-shells">Electron Orbital Shells</h2>
								</div>

								<p>Electron shells</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Each electron shell has 1 s orbital</li>
									<li>Each electron shell after the first one has 3 p orbitals</li>
									<li>Each electron shell after the second one has 5 d orbitals</li>
									<li>Each electron shell after the third one has 7 f orbitals</li>
									<li>Up to two electrons can exist in each of the orbitals</li>

								</ul>

								<div class="big-section-heading">
									<h2 id="what-are-electron-orbitals-orbital-placement">Rules for Figuring Out which Orbital an Electron Takes</h2>
								</div>

								<p>There are three rules that determine the orbital that an electron occupies. These rules are known as the Aufbau Principle, the Paulie Exclusion Principle, and Hund's Rule</p>

								<ul>
									<li>The Aufbau Principle states that an electron will always go into the orbital with the lowest energy<br> (s < p < d < f)</li>
									<li>The Paulie Exclusion Principle argues that no more than two electrons can occupy an atomic orbital and those two electrons must have an opposite spin</li>
									<li>Hund's rule argues that when two or more atomic oribtals have the same energy, an electron will occupy the empty orbital before it pairs with another electron</li>
										<ul>
											<li>This means that each p, d, or f orbital will each have one electron in them before any electrons start to pair</li>
										</ul>
								</ul>

								<div class="big-section-heading">
									<h2 id="what-are-electron-orbitals-valence-and-core-electrons">Valence and Core Electrons</h2>
								</div>

								<p>There are two types of electrons that you will likely need to know about in your course: valence and core electrons</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Valence electrons are the electrons that are in an atom's outermost shell</li>
									<li>Core electrons are the electrons that are in an atom's inner shell</li>
									<li>Valence electrons play a substantial role in chemical bonding and determining an element's chemical behavior</li>
									<li>Core electrons are just kind of there, hoping to one day become valence electrons</li>
								</ul>

								<div class="big-section-heading">
									<h2 id="what-are-electron-orbitals-octet-rule">The Octet Rule</h2>
								</div>

								<p>The octet rule explains a tendency that electrons have for filling up the outer shell of atoms.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>An atom will give up, share, or take electrons to get their outer shells filled</li>
									<li>Each element in the first column of the periodic table usually gives away an element</li>
									<li>Each element in the last column of the periodic table usually... </li>

								<ul>
									<li>Covalent bonds are usually represented with a line f-f shows a covalent bond between two flourine atoms</li>

								<div class="equations">
									<span>$$\lambda = \hbar / mv$$</span> 
								</div>

								<p>A scientist named Louis de Broglie correctly argued that particles like electrons probably have wavelike characteristics</p>

								<ul>
									<li>The basic idea is that particles with a mass and velocity should have a wavelength</li>
									<li>Wavelength is represented with the symbol &Lambda;, which is called lambda</li>
									<li>A wavelength is basically the distance between identical, adjacent wave points</li>
									<li>The value of a wavelength can be calculated by multiplying the particle's mass and volume, and then dividing Planck's constant by that value</li>
									<li>Your instructor or textbook might tell you to that a wavelength is the quotient of Planck's constant and the product of the particle's mass and volume, don't worry, it means the same thing as the last bullet point</li>
									<li>Planck's constant is 6.626 * 10<sup>-34</sup></li>

								<p>Frequency is the number of wave crests that pass a certain point in a specified amount of time.</p>

								<div class="common-problem">
									<p>It is fairly common to be given a problem where you are asked to figure out an Electron's wavelength in a given unit when it is traveling at a given speed.</p>
									<p class="question">In meters, calculate the wavelength of an electron travelling at 3.67 * 10<sup>8</sup> m/s</p>
								</div>

								<div class="big-section-heading">
									<h2 id="">Explanation</h2>
								</div>

								<p>To solve a problem such as this, you first need to know the mass of an electron (usually measured in grams), which is 9.11 * 10<sup>-28</sup>g. Additionally, you will need to convert the mass of the electron from grams to kilograms so the units cancel out later in the problem. Knowing that, you can use the de Broglie equation to finish the problem.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Convert the weight of the electron from mass to kilograms: 9.11 * 10<sup>-28</sup>g * <sup>1 kg</sup>/<sub>1000 g</sub></li>
