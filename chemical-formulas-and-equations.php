								<p>A substance's chemical formula is a line of text that represents the cehmical composition of the substance</p>
								<ul>
									<li>It shows which elements are present and in what ratios</li>
									<li>You can think of it as representing the number of atoms of each element present in a substance</li>
									<li>A number called a <span class="emphasize">subscript</span> follows each elemet symbol and it demonstrates how many of thats specific element are in a molecule of that compound</li>
									<li>For example, <span class="emphasize">water's chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O</span> indicates that a molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms per single oxygen atom</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<p>Chemical formulas that have two or more of the same compound show it with a parenthesis</p>
								<ul>
									<li>For example, (OH)<sub>2</sub> means that there are 2 hydroxide (OH) molecules</li>
									<li>When you come across something like this, all you have to do to figure out the amount of elements in a molecule of the compound is <span class="emphasize">multiply the numbers inside the parenthesis by the number outside of it</span> and the resulting numbers show the amount of elements in the compound</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<p><span class="emphasize">A structural formula</span> is different than a chemical formula in that a structural formula also shows the in which the atoms are connected.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The lines that you will sometimes see connecting chemical symbols are meant to represent chemical bonds between the elements</li>
									<li>These chemical bonds hold atoms together at various angles and distances</li>
								</ul>
